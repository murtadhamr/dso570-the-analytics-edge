Payoffs happen at the beginning of the year, so can be reinvested in the same year. For example, the positive cash flow received from Option C in Year 1 can be reinvested immediately in Option B. However, Finco cannot borrow funds, so net cash on hand must be non-negative in all years. Formulate this as a linear optimization problem."

    "A company sells items of various sizes and ships them to customers using special boxes. While the sizes of the items are fixed, the company can decide what sized boxes to use for shipping.

For example, a type-1 item can be shipped with a box of size 1.5, but can also be shipped using boxes of sizes 1.7 or 2.0. \n",
    "\n",
    "While larger boxes are more flexible, they are also more expensive to make: **the variable cost** (in dollars) of making each box is exactly equal to the box size. However, the higher variable cost might be worth it since to produce a box of a certain size, the company needs to pay a **fixed cost** of 1000 to create the mold. So using larger boxes might allow the company to make do with fewer box types, which would lower the total fixed cost. For example, using boxes of all three types would incur a fixed cost of 3000, while using only boxes of size 2.0 would incur a fixed cost of 1000. \n",

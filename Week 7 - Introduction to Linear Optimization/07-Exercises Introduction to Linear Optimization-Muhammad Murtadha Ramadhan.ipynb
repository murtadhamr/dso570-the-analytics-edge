    "- 4: Almost complete, but certain questions are blank, the code there does not run, or the output is clearly incorrect. For math formulations, this would be if the formulation is seriously flawed. \n",
    "- 3: This score will not be assigned, as everyone should strive to get 4 or 5.\n",
    "- 2: Not close to complete, but at least 50% complete.\n",
    "- 1: At least 10% complete, but less than 50% complete\n",
    "- 0: Less than 10% complete, or response is identical to someone else's, indicating plagiarism.\n",
    "\n",
    "A perfect score is 5. Note that your code does not need to be absolutely perfect to receive a 5, but you need to complete every question and ensure that the outputs are correct on all of the sample runs included here. Furthermore, you should double check that your math formulations make sense, by plugging in concrete numbers and verifying that the constraints are satisfied. \n",

    "A perfect score is 5. Note that your code does not need to be absolutely perfect to receive a 5, but you need to complete every question and ensure that the outputs are correct on all of the sample runs included here. Furthermore, you should double check that your math formulations make sense, by plugging in concrete numbers and verifying that the constraints are satisfied. \n",

    "\n",
    "A committee at USC Marshall is exploring the viability of in-person instruction while observing social distancing guidelines. One challenge is that certain classrooms have tables and seats bolted to the floor, and the seats cannot be moved unless the rooms undergo significant remodeling. As an illustration, the following image is a portion of the floor plan for JKP204, and the numbers in the image correspond to the individual seats. As you can see, the distance between adjacent seats can be quite close, and the room would be overly dense if every seat is used. Since the seats cannot be moved, only a subset of them can be used to seat students. "

(For simplicity, the distance between two seated students is defined to be the straight-line distance between the center of the two seats.) Based on discussions with public health officials, the committee has summarized the requirements for safely seating students as follows:\n",

    "1. The minimum distance between any two seated students is at least 6 feet.\n",
    "2. For every seated student, the number of other students seated within a 9 feet radius is at most 3, so the density of the room is kept low.

There is a certain set of demand regions, each with a given estimated demand, which is the maximum number of units you can sell in that region per month. It is possible to not fulfill all the demand, as that corresponds to having the item being stocked out for some customers. The price that you charge when sell the item may be different in each region, but the prices are determined by another department, so is outside of your control. \n",

    "Create an abstract formulation of a linear optimization problem to determine a plan for producing and shipping items, so as to maximize total profit, which is the revenue from the selling the product minus the production and transportation costs. You formulation must be flexible enough to handle arbitrary sets of production plants and regions, and none of the numbers in the above description can be hardcoded.\n",
